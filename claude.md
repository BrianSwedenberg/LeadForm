# CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions

> This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
> Follow these instructions for the entire session unless explicitly overridden by the user in the prompt.

---

## 1. First Steps — Every Session

Before writing any code, do the following in order:

1. Read `SPEC.md` in full
2. Check the current phase in `SPEC.md` Section 6 and confirm which backend is active
3. Review the relevant Stitch export in `/designs/` if working on a UI step
4. Confirm your understanding of the task with a one-sentence summary before starting

---

## 2. Current Phase

**Phase 2 — Supabase**

- All form submissions go through `submitLead.ts` → `supabase.rpc('submit_lead', ...)`
- The `submit_lead()` SECURITY DEFINER function lives in `supabase/migrations/20260408000003_submit_lead_fn.sql` and is applied to the remote DB
- Do **not** revert to the n8n webhook path — the commented Phase 1 block in `submitLead.ts` is kept for reference only
- Supabase project: **WaterCRM** (`kesxpzvfnqdbrfxxlxua`); all 4 migrations are applied remotely

---

## 3. Code Quality Standards

These are non-negotiable. Every file committed must meet these standards.

### Clarity
- Code should read like plain English where possible
- Prefer explicit over clever — no one-liners that require deciphering
- Every function should do exactly one thing
- If a comment is needed to explain *what* code does, rewrite the code. Comments explain *why*, not *what*

### Component design
- One component per file, no exceptions
- Components should be small and focused — if a component is doing more than one job, split it
- No business logic inside JSX — extract to a hook or utility function
- No inline styles — all styling via Tailwind classes from the Stitch export

### Naming
- Be descriptive. `handleStepAdvance` not `handleClick`. `isSubmitting` not `flag`
- Booleans always prefixed: `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`
- Event handlers always prefixed: `handle`
- Custom hooks always prefixed: `use`

### No spaghetti
- No prop drilling beyond two levels — use the Zustand store
- No component should import from another component's folder
- Shared utilities live in `src/lib/`, shared types in `src/types/`, shared UI in `src/components/ui/`
- `submitLead.ts` is the only file that may reference the backend endpoint

---

## 4. Performance Standards

- **Bundle target:** under 80KB gzipped for the embed build
- Lazy-initialize the Supabase client (Phase 2) — do not import it at the top level
- Use CSS transforms only for animations — never animate `height`, `width`, `top`, `left`
- No animation should exceed 300ms duration
- Do not install a new dependency to solve a problem that can be solved in under 20 lines of native code
- Before installing any new package, state its name, purpose, and approximate bundle size impact

### Dependency additions
> Before running `npm install` for any package not already in `SPEC.md`:
> 1. Stop and flag it to the user
> 2. Explain what it's for and why it's needed
> 3. State the approximate bundle size impact
> 4. Wait for approval

---

## 5. Design Implementation

- Design source of truth is the Stitch export in `/designs/`
- For each step, reference `code.html` for Tailwind classes and `DESIGN.md` for rationale
- Do not invent colors, spacing, or typography — derive everything from the export
- If a design detail is ambiguous: check `DESIGN.md` → check `screen.png` → use best judgment and leave a `// DESIGN QUESTION:` comment

---

## 6. Folder Structure

> Do not create files outside this structure without asking first.

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── steps/        # One file per form step, named Step01PropertyType.tsx etc.
│   └── ui/           # Shared primitives: Button, Card, ProgressBar, Input, etc.
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks, one per file
├── store/            # Zustand store(s)
├── lib/
│   ├── submitLead.ts # Only file that touches the backend — Phase 1: n8n, Phase 2: Supabase
│   └── validation.ts # Zod schemas
├── types/            # Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
└── App.tsx
```

## 7. Before Making Any Significant Change

**Stop and ask the user before proceeding if the change involves any of the following:**

- Modifying the folder structure
- Installing a new dependency
- Changing the submission logic in `submitLead.ts`
- Refactoring a component that is already working
- Changing the Zustand store shape
- Modifying `vite.config.ts`
- Any change that touches more than 3 files simultaneously

**When asking, always provide:**

1. **What** — a plain-English description of the proposed change
2. **Why** — the specific reason this change is necessary or beneficial
3. **Scope** — which files will be created, modified, or deleted
4. **Risk** — anything that could break or regress as a result

Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves. "Looks good" or "go ahead" is sufficient approval.

---

## 8. Git Discipline

- Do not run `git commit` or `git push` unless explicitly asked
- Do not create new branches unless explicitly asked
- Do suggest logical commit points and propose a commit message when a discrete unit of work is complete

---

## 9. When You're Unsure

- Do not guess at business logic — ask
- Do not guess at design intent — leave a `// DESIGN QUESTION:` comment
- Do not guess at data schema — leave a `// ASSUMPTION:` comment with your reasoning
- A short clarifying question is always better than 100 lines of wrong code

## 10. Documentation Workflow

When completing a feature, module, or significant code change:
- Create or update a corresponding Notion page in the [Project Docs] database
- Page should include: what was built, key decisions made, and any known limitations
- Use the existing page structure: Summary → Technical Details → Open Questions

## 11. Notion Workspace Structure
- Technical docs live in: https://www.notion.so/LeadForm-Documentation-33a8d07d042280789f19ddc875a282a7
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) go in: https://www.notion.so/LeadForm-ADR-33a8d07d042280c4a0faf2ec7ea7dccc?source=copy_link
- Do not create top-level pages — always nest under the relevant parent

## Documentation Protocol

### CURRENT_STATE.md — Source of Truth
There is a `CURRENT_STATE.md` file in the /docs/ directory of this project. It is the 
single source of truth for the current state of the application. Always read 
it at the start of any session before doing anything else.

### When to update CURRENT_STATE.md
Update it at the end of every task, or any time you make a change that affects:
- The database schema (columns added, types changed, RLS policies updated)
- The API or submission endpoint
- Environment variables or configuration
- The deployment state (what is live on Vercel right now)
- TypeScript types or interfaces that reflect the data model
- Any completed milestone or phase

### How to update it
- Edit in place — do not append a history log, do not create dated entries
- It should always reflect right now, not a timeline of changes
- Be specific: column names, types, nullability — not just "schema was updated"
- If something was removed, remove it from the doc too
- Keep it concise. It is a briefing document, not a narrative

### What does not belong in CURRENT_STATE.md
- Reasons why decisions were made (that lives in SPEC.md)
- Task lists or to-dos (keep those in the task file for the current phase)
- Anything speculative or in-progress — only confirmed, working state
